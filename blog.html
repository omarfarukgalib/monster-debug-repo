            <p>
                <h3 class="container">Local Storage</h3>
<p class="container">Local storage is used for storing data locally on a uses browser, like saving user preferences or other settings. It is persisted through page reloads and stays with the browser until it is cleared manually or through a setting.</p>

<h3 class="container">Session Storage</h3>
<p class="container">Session storage acts in a similar way to local storage. The only difference here is that while data stored in local storage has an expiration date, the data stored in session storage will expire as soon as the page’s session ends, that’s it, when the page is closed.</p>
