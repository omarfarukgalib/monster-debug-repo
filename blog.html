                <h3 class="container text-muted">Local Storage</h3>
<p class="container fw-bold text-muted">Local storage is used for storing data locally on a uses browser, like saving user preferences or other settings. It is persisted through page reloads and stays with the browser until it is cleared manually or through a setting.</p>

<h3 class="container text-muted">Session Storage</h3>
<p class="container fw-bold text-muted">Session storage acts in a similar way to local storage. The only difference here is that while data stored in local storage has an expiration date, the data stored in session storage will expire as soon as the page’s session ends, that’s it, when the page is closed.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center">Difference between global scope and block scope</h2>
            <p>
                <h3 class="container text-muted">global scope</h3>
<p class="container fw-bold text-muted">A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a variable is declared outside all functions or curly braces ({}), it exists in the global scope. The global variables can be accessed by any line of code in the program, including inside blocks.</p>

<h3 class="container text-muted">block scope</h3>
<p class="container fw-bold text-muted">
    So far, we’ve seen variables defined with the var keyword. Var can declare a variable either in the global or local scope. The variables that are declared within the block scope are comparable to local ones. They are available within the block that they are defined.

The main difference between the local scope and block scope is that the block statements (e.g. if conditions or for loops), don't create a new scope. So the var keyword will not have an effect, because the variables are still in the same scope.
ES6 introduced block scope by using the let and const keywords. These two keywords are scoped within the block which are defined.
